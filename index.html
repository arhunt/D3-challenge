          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>WASHINGTON, DC - Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System show that states with lower median household incomes and higher poverty have higher rates of smoking, obesity, and lack of health insurance.</p>

          <p>Median age was also taken into consideration: whereas 'older' states had lower rates of uninsured, they also had somewhat higher rates of smokers.  Age did not come through as a clear indicator of obesity.</p>
